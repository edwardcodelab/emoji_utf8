Emoji Substitution Plugin for DokuWiki (UTF-8 Fork)
This is a fork of the original Emoji plugin by Patrick Brown. The core functionality remains the sameâ€”allowing emoji characters or shortcut names to be inserted into wiki pagesâ€”but this version shifts from PNG image rendering to native UTF-8 emoji characters for a lighter, more modern experience. Shortnames are converted to Unicode on-the-fly during editing and rendered as UTF-8 text in previews and final pages.
Key Features

* Real-Time Editing Conversion: Type :smile: followed by space, period, or Enterâ€”it auto-replaces with ðŸ˜„ directly in the textarea.

* Autocomplete Dropdown: Start typing :smi for suggestions showing live emojis (e.g., ðŸ˜„ :smile:). Select to insert the UTF-8 emoji.

* Input Methods:

  * Copy-paste Unicode characters (e.g., ðŸ˜„).

  * Type shortnames (e.g., :smile:).

  * Type emoticons (e.g., :-)).

* Rendering: Outputs native UTF-8 emojis in previews, final pages, and exports (no PNG images or dependencies).

* Syntax Safety: Shortnames and emoticons need spaces around them to avoid conflicts (e.g., C:D won't trigger :D).

* Emoji List: Shortnames from EmojiOne strategy (e.g., :grinning:, :thumbsup:).

Installation

1. Download and extract to lib/plugins/emoji_utf8/.

2. Clear cache via Admin > Configuration Settings > Cache.

3. No additional assets needed (PNG support disabled).

Usage
To insert a smiling face:

* Copy the Unicode: ðŸ˜„

* Type :smile: (auto-converts during edit)

* Type :-) (converts to ðŸ˜„)

Example wiki text: Hello :smile: world! Renders as: Hello ðŸ˜„ world!
For full shortname list, see emoji.codes.
